The only necessary file is out_the_liers.ipynb, it converts to -log(something), removes outliers and duplicates based on z-score,
only things you must alter are the commented portions that need user input
Works with csv, and xlsx
Can be a file or multiple in a directory at once
If multiple files only allow then actual data files in the directory
can have multiple sheets or just one
